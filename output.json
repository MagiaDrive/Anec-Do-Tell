While uttering one sentence he should be able to think of the next. This is possible, but possible only when a perfect presence of mind is acquired. It is possible, by use and training, even for one who halts in common conversation, to be nevertheless fluent when on the platform. It is lack of this attainable self-possession which causes speakers to blunder.

One fine day pussy had seated herself on top of the gate-post, as if in a profound study, when about a dozen swallows, knowing her to be an enemy, began to tantalize her in a way which showed a high degree of humor. A bird would approach from behind and fly close by her ear, when she made an unsuccessful effort to seize the rude fellow with her paw. One after another the birds repeated this practical joke, and all of them seemed to relish it exceedingly. The whole number, following one another at a distance of a few yards, formed a regular circle in the air; and, going round like a wheel, they fairly wore out the cat\u2019s patience, and she had indignantly to descend from the gate-post.\u2014 Baptist World."

For one thing, he always wants boots that are several sizes too large, for he believes that in that way he gets more value for his money. In addition to excessive size, boots may have to possess other peculiar characteristics before they meet his full approval, as the following story indicates: A California merchant offered a pair of fine boots that he had long kept in stock to a Chinese for three dollars. The Oriental finally took them, but two days later he brought them back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble, John?\u201d inquired the merchant. \u201cHim good boots.\u201d \u201cHim no good,\u201d declared John. \u201cHim no sing-song boot.

During that year the prince was touring the United States with a numerous suite under the name of Lord Renfrew. While on his way to St. Louis the future King of England left his special car at Dwight\u2019s Station and spent two days shooting in Clinton County. On the second day, the prince got lost and wandered for hours in the Santa Fe bottoms separated from the rest of his party. During this time he came to a farmer\u2019s hut and demanded that the farmer should take him to his headquarters. The farmer calmly refused. The hunter then asked him if he knew he was addressing the Prince of Wales. The farmer answered he \u201cdidn\u2019t give a continental if the hunter was the Queen of England.\u201d The prince then tried hiring him, but he said he wasn\u2019t for hire. It was quite obvious that he mistrusted the royalty of the man who had approached him. Finally Albert Edward succeeded in discovering a young Irishman who steered him back to the station. There have been a good many illustrations of people entertaining angels unawares, but perhaps there are not many cases on record where a farmer refused to entertain a prince because he doubted his identity. It all goes to show that it is quite easy to be mistaken in such matters and that the safe rule is to be courteous and benevolent at all times.\u2014 Selected."

There is a peculiarity of railroad men that even on social occasions you will find that they always take their lawyer with them. That is why I am here. They never go anywhere without their counsel. Now they have nearly everything that men want, but I have a suggestion to make to you for an exchange with us. We can give free passes on all the railroads of the country.

The attack comes on suddenly every Sunday; no symptoms are felt on Saturday night; the patient sleeps well, eats a hearty breakfast, but about church time the attack comes on, and continues till services are over for the morning. Then the patient feels easy and eats a hearty dinner. In the afternoon he feels much better, and he is able to take a walk and talk about politics; but about church time he gets another attack, and stays at home. He retires early, sleeps well, and wakes up on Monday morning refreshed and able to go to work, and does not have any symptoms of the disease until next Sunday.\u201d The vicar, in the same manner, suggests a remedy: \u201cOn Sunday,\u201d he says, \u201crise at seven; use plenty of cold water. Then mix up and take internally a dose composed of equal parts of the following ingredients\u2014namely, will, push, energy, determination, self-respect for God\u2019s day, respect for God\u2019s Book, respect for God\u2019s house.

For many weeks he labored, only to be dissatisfied with the result. \u201cIt is too sweet and too suave,\u201d he commented. \u201cIt has none of the characteristics of this particular, great city, in spite of my dissonances and cacophony. I have surely not made use of the right instruments.\u201d So he removed the caressing strings and replaced them with automobile horns. This brought it decidedly nearer the effect desired. Then the birdlike flutes and reeds were out of place, and gave way to a brace of trolley-gongs. The horns and gongs outbalanced the brasses and tympani, which in turn made place for a quartette of ferry whistles. And yet the discord lacked much of typifying New York; so a riveting-machine was added, and then a rock-drill. And after many more weeks of thought, worry, and experiment, the other things that were necessary for the rounding out of this monumental task. When the symphony was finally completed and its composer acclaimed a greater musician than Richard Strauss the instruments that were lined up for its interpretation were: 20 first auto horns. 20 taxi auto horns. 10 trolley-car gongs. 4 elevated-train rumblers. 4 subway-train rumblers. 6 bass motor-truck horns. 4 ferry whistles. 2 tug sirens. 2 steam rock-drills. 2 riveting-machines. 18 milkmen\u2019s bells. 10 yelling newsboys. 1 fire-engine. 14 popping champagne-bottles. 4 Grand Central engine bells and whistles. 1 ambulance gong. 16 typewriters. 12 cash-registers. 1 derrick whistle. 1 dynamite blast. 8 revolving vestibule-doors. 2 ticket-choppers. 14 swearing motor-men. 10 elevated and subway conductors calling stations.   \u2014 New York Sun."

Mrs. Hen, thinking that polly was after her chicks, spread her wings and darted at the \u201cqueer looking thing.\u201d Then I arrived on the scene, to give first aid to the injured. Mother Hen was just ready to peck poor polly when she came to a sudden halt and drew back in astonishment. Polly turned and faced her, held up one foot and remarked, \u201cYou quit. Quit, I tell you!\u201d Quick to take advantage of time gained, polly tried to get away, and the grape arbor, that grape arbor looked so good to him, but, oh, it was so far away. Polly ran, stumbled and chuckled as he hurried along, but parrots are so slow in motion that he had made very little progress before \u201cMa Hen,\u201d recovering, made another dive for him. Again polly faced about, just in time to escape the hen peck, and gave an awful squawk. \u201cMa Hen\u201d halted, of course, as polly screamed, \u201cNow you quit!\u201d The hen, stepping forward, took one more look at the hook-nosed green thing that spoke to her, then ran like mad back to her chicks. She called them together, counted them, and found them all safe, but gave yet another curious and resentful glance at that queer-looking intruder which was green and talked like a man. \u2014 Mrs. L.

A clerk in a certain city office was leaving the building the other day, when he was called to the telephone. Immediately he took up the receiver, and heard the voice at the other end of the wire; he raised his hat in the best style, and spluttered out a \u201cYes, sir!\u201d When the conversation ended he again raised his hat. He had been talking to the \u201cboss.\u201d Another man in the city, who is famous for his gesticulation when holding conversation, was one day attempting to convince a customer on the telephone of the advantage of something or another. Presently he began waving his free arm, thumping the desk and working his mouth and face like India rubber. Still making no progress, he put the receiver down, so that both hands were free, and, standing before the telephone, went on as if he were addressing a street-corner meeting. When he had \u201crun down\u201d he realized that he had not had the receiver to his ear to listen to the other man.
