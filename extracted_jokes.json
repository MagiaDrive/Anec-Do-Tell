Every other word was an expletive; those that weren't expletives were, to  say the least, rude. Bob tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words,  playing soft  music...anything he could think of. Nothing worked.  He yelled at the bird, and the bird got worse. He shook the bird, and the  bird got madder and more rude.  Finally, in a moment of desperation, Bob put the parrot in the freezer.  For a few moments he heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking and  screaming and then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet. Bob was frightened that he might  have actually  hurt the bird, and quickly opened the freezer door.  The parrot calmly stepped out onto Bob's extended arm and said, \"I'm sorry  that I offended you with my language and my actions, and I ask your forgiveness. I will  endeavour to correct  my behaviour\".  Bob was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about to  ask what had changed him, when the parrot continued, \"May I ask what the Chicken  did?\""

Well, the pig farmer feels pretty stupid about this, but decides to give it a try.  But in order to  avoid anyone seeing this, he piles the pigs up in the truck and drives them to a hidden part of  the farm, way in the back.  He \"teaches\" of all the pigs, which exhausts him and then hauls  them back to the pen.  The next morning he asks his wife to check if the pigs are breeding, she tell him they aren't.    Wearily, he goes out and \"teaches\" them all over again.   The next morning he asks his wife if they are breeding yet and she says \"No\".  Frustrated and  exhausted, he asks, \"Well, what are they doing?!?!\" To which his wife replies, \"Sitting in the  truck, honking the horn.\""
